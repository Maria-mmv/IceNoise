#### Simulation of the noise generated by radio emission from ice.
Ice is assumed to radiate as a black body.

Class channelIceNoiseAdder, adds noise, same as  [channelGalacticNoiseAdder](https://github.com/nu-radio/NuRadioMC/blob/develop/NuRadioReco/modules/channelGalacticNoiseAdder.py)

```
ice  = medium.southpole_2015()   
ice_model = "SP1"

for evt in eventReader.run():
  for station in evt.get_stations():       
    channelIceNoiseAdder.run(evt, station, det,ice,ice_model)
```
